    we will remove last digit from binary representation of both left
    and right number until we reach a point where both have same 
    element at the same position.
    And will also keep track of how many times we removed elements 
    by keeping a count of it.

    lets apply it practically:

    first loop:
                101 >> 1 = 10
                111 >> 1 = 11
                cnt = 1

    Second loop:
                10 >> 1 = 1
                11 >> 1 = 1
                cnt = 2

    Third loop:
                1 == 1 

    So now since they are equal we will add those many 0's at the 
    end of the current element we have by using left shift operator.

        1 << cnt  = 1 << 2  => 100(4) 

    Result = 4

    let count = 0;
    while (left != right) {
        left >>= 1;
        right >>= 1;
        count++;
    }
    return left << count;
};
